-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT user_type, AVG(completed_goals) AS avg_completed_goals
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, user_type, COUNT(*) AS completed_goals
    FROM user_goals
    WHERE goal_status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY user_id, user_type
) AS user_completions
GROUP BY user_type
ORDER BY avg_completed_goals DESC;
