-- Santa wants to analyze which toys that were produced in his workshop have already been delivered to children. You are given two tables on toy production and toy delivery — can you return the toy ID and toy name of the toys that have been delivered?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: toy_production
--   toy_id: INTEGER
--   toy_name: VARCHAR
--   production_date: DATE
--
-- Table: toy_delivery
--   toy_id: INTEGER
--   child_name: VARCHAR
--   delivery_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT D.toy_id, P.toy_name
  FROM toy_delivery D INNER JOIN toy_production P ON D.toy_id=P.toy_id
  WHERE D.delivery_date IS NOT NULL
