-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
    resort_name, 
    SUM(snowfall_inches) AS total_annual_snowfall, 
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(snowfall_inches)) AS snowfall_quartile 
FROM 
    resort_monthly_snowfall 
GROUP BY 
    resort_id, resort_name;
