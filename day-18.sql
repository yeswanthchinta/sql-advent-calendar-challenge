-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
  subject, 
  FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date) AS first_score, 
  LAST_VALUE(score) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_score 
FROM 
  daily_quiz_scores 
order BY 
  subject;
